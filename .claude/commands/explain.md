# Explain Code (Junior Developer Friendly)

Explain the code I’m pointing to **as if I am a junior developer**.

Your explanation should be clear, friendly, and easy to understand.  
Assume I am still learning and may not know advanced concepts yet.

---

## What to Explain

### 1. High-Level Overview

- Explain **what the code does overall**
- Describe the **main purpose** of the code
- Answer the question:  
  **“Why does this code exist?”**

---

### 2. Major Sections Breakdown

- Walk through the code **section by section**
- Explain what each major part does
- Describe **how the parts work together**
- If there are functions, hooks, classes, or modules:
  - Explain their role in simple terms

---

### 3. Design Decisions

- Explain **why certain decisions might have been made**
- Examples:
  - Why a specific library or tool is used
  - Why the logic is structured this way
  - Why certain values, patterns, or approaches were chosen
- If there are alternatives, briefly mention them and why this one was likely chosen

---

### 4. Gotchas & Tricky Parts

- Point out anything that is:
  - Easy to misunderstand
  - Easy to break if changed incorrectly
  - Sensitive to edge cases
- Explain **why** these parts are tricky
- Mention what a junior developer should be careful about

---

## Style Guidelines

- Use **simple and clear language**
- Avoid jargon
  - If you must use technical terms, **explain them first**
- Prefer short sentences and clear explanations
- Use examples when helpful
- Do not assume advanced knowledge

---

## Goal

By the end of the explanation, a junior developer should:

- Understand what the code does
- Understand how the main parts work
- Feel confident reading and modifying the code
- Know which parts require extra caution

---

Explain patiently and clearly. The goal is learning, not just describing.
